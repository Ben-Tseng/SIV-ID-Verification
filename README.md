# SIV-ID-Verification
Passport MRZ, HK ID, and TW ID verification assisted tool

Overview

Due to strict data security and compliance requirements, all internal development and verification tools in our company must not exchange any data with external systems or third‑party services.

This repository contains a set of purely client‑side, offline-capable validation tools designed to assist internal operations  without transmitting any personal data outside the user’s local environment.

All logic runs entirely in the browser (HTML + JavaScript). No APIs, no network requests, and no data persistence are involved.
